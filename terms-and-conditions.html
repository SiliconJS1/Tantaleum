                                        <h3>Tantaleum - Terms and conditions</h3>

                                            <p>The following Terms (“Terms”) govern the investment procedure (“Investments” collectively, and “Investment” individually) to Tantaleum by Investors (“Investors” collectively, and “Investor” individually) and the subsequent genesis allocation of transferable cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units called TNLs (“TNL”) to Investors. This document is not a solicitation for investment and does not pertain in any way to an offering of securities in any jurisdiction. This document describes the ICO in which the token (TNL) is sold.</p>

                                         <h3>IMPORTANT</h3>
                    <p>Ownership of TNL during the ICO carries no rights express or implied. Investments in the crowdsale are non-refundable. Investors should have no expectation of mandatory influence over governance of the platform. By participating in the sale of TNL, you expressly acknowledge and represent that you have carefully reviewed the Terms and fully understand the costs, and benefits of contributing in the crowdsale and agree to be bound by these Terms. As set forth below, you further represent and warrant that, to the extent permitted by law, you are authorized to invest in the crowdsale in your relevant jurisdiction, are of a legal age to be bound by these Terms, and will not hold TNL, its parent and affiliates, and the officers, directors, agents, joint ventures, employees and suppliers of TNL or our parent or affiliates, now or in the future and any other member of the Tantaleum Team (collectively the Tantaleum Team &amp; Parties”) liable for any losses or any special, incidental, or consequential damages arising out of, or in any way connected to the sale of TNL.</p>

                    <br/>
                    
                    <h3>DO NOT INVEST IN THE CROWDSALE IF YOU ARE NOT AN EXPERT IN DEALING WITH CRYPTOGRAPHIC TOKENS AND BLOCKCHAIN-BASED SOFTWARE SYSTEMS</h3>
                    <p>Investments in the crowdsale should be undertaken only by individuals, entities, or companies that have significant experience with, and understanding of, the usage and intricacies of cryptographic tokens, like bitcoin (“BTC”), ethereum (“ETH”) and blockchain based software systems. Investors should have functional understanding of storage and transmission mechanisms associated with other cryptographic tokens. While the Tantaleum Team will be available to assist Investors of TNL during the sale, the Tantaleum Team will not be responsible in any way for loss of BTC, ETH, Fiat or TNL resulting from actions taken by, or omitted by Investors. If you do not have such experience or expertise, then you should not invest TNL or participate in the sale of TNL.</p>

                    <br/>
                    
                    <h3>WARNING: INVESTORS IN THE CROWDSALE MUST BE MADE AWARE OF CERTAIN FACTORS</h3>
                    <p>Prior to contributing the crowdsale, you should carefully consider the terms listed below and, to the extent necessary, consult an appropriate lawyer, accountant, or tax professional. If any of the following terms are unacceptable to you, you should not invest in the sale. By contributing in the crowdsale, and to the extent permitted by law, you are agreeing not to hold any of the The Tantaleum Team &amp; Parties liable for any losses or any special, incidental, or consequential damages arising from, or in any way connected, to the sale of TNL, including losses associated with the terms set forth below.</p>

If your private key(s) or other access credentials are lost, you may lose access to your TNL. We are not responsible for any such losses.</p></li>
                        
                        <li><h6>Refunds</h6><p>ALL Investments IN THE CROWDSALE ARE FINAL. Investments IN THE CROWDSALE ARE NON-REFUNDABLE. BY CONTRIBUTING IN THE SALE, THE INVESTOR ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE TANTALEUM TEAM &amp; PARTIES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT THE INVESTOR WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR ANY TNL THAT IS NOT USED OR REMAINS UNUSED.</p></li>
                        
                        <li><h6>Taxation of TNL and Taxation Related to the ICO</h6><p>The Investor bears the sole responsibility to determine if the investment of TNL with ETH or the potential appreciation or depreciation in the value of TNL over time has tax implications for the Investor in the Investor’s home jurisdiction. By purchasing TNL, and to the extent permitted by law, the Investor agrees not to hold any of the The Tantaleum Team &amp; Parties liable for any tax liability associated with or arising from investment in the crowdsale.</p></li>
                        
                        <li><h6>Disclaimer of Warranties</h6><p>THE INVESTOR EXPRESSLY AGREES THAT THE INVESTOR IS CONTRIBUTING IN THE CROWDSALE AT THE INVESTOR’S SOLE RISK AND THAT TNL IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE (EXCEPT ONLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW WITH ANY LEGALLY REQUIRED WARRANTY PERIOD TO THE SHORTER OF THIRTY DAYS FROM FIRST USE OR THE MINIMUM PERIOD REQUIRED). WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, NONE OF THE TANTALEUM TEAM &amp; PARTIES WARRANT THAT THE PROCESS FOR CONTRIBUTING IN THE CROWDSALE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.</p></li>
                        
                        <li><h6>Limitations Waiver of Liability</h6><p>THE INVESTOR ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY ANY APPLICABLE LAW, THE DISCLAIMERS OF LIABILITY CONTAINED HEREIN APPLY TO ANY AND ALL DAMAGES OR INJURY WHATSOEVER CAUSED BY OR RELATED TO USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, TNL OR THE TANTALEUM TEAM &amp; PARTIES UNDER ANY CAUSE OR ACTION WHATSOEVER OF ANY KIND IN ANY JURISDICTION, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ACTIONS FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY, BREACH OF CONTRACT OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) AND THAT NONE OF THE TANTALEUM PARTIES SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL OR DATA, IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, OR INVEST OF, OR INABILITY TO INVEST IN THE CROWDSALE. THE INVESTOR FURTHER SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE TANTALEUM TEAM &amp; PARTIES ARE NOT LIABLE FOR THE CONDUCT OF THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING OTHER INVESTORS IN THE CROWDSALE, AND THAT THE RISK OF CONTRIBUTING IN THE CROWDSALE AND USING TNL RESTS ENTIRELY WITH THE INVESTOR. TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL ANY OF THE THE TANTALEUM TEAM &amp; PARTIES BE LIABLE TO ANY INVESTOR FOR MORE THAN THE AMOUNT THE INVESTOR HAS PAID TO CROWDSALE INVESTMENT. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DAMAGES. THEREFORE, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION AND ELSEWHERE IN THE TERMS MAY NOT APPLY TO A INVESTOR. IN PARTICULAR, NOTHING IN THESE TERMS SHALL AFFECT THE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF ANY INVESTOR OR EXCLUDE INJURY ARISING FROM ANY WILFUL MISCONDUCT OR FRAUD OF THE TANTALEUM TEAM</p></li>
                        
                        <li>
                            <h6>Project outcome</h6><p>The Tantaleum Team is not liable for failure for any reason including, but not limited to:</br>
                                - unavoidable casualty,</br>
                                - delays in delivery of materials,</br>
                                - Embargoes,</br>

                                - or any similar unforeseen event that renders performance commercially implausible. If an event of force majeure occurs, the party injured by the other’s inability to perform may elect to suspend the Agreement, in whole or part, for the duration of the force majeure circumstances. The party experiencing the force majeure circumstances shall cooperate with and assist the injured party in all reasonable ways to minimize the impact of force majeure on the injured party.</br>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li><h6>Complete Agreement</h6><p>These Terms set forth the entire understanding between each Investor and The Tantaleum Team with respect to the sale of TNL. For facts relating to the sale and Investments, the Investor agrees to rely only on these two documents in determining investment decisions and understands that these documents govern the sale of TNL and supersede any public statements about the ICO made by third parties or by the Tantaleum Team or individuals associated with any of the Tantaleum Team &amp; Parties, past and present and during the ICO.</p></li>
                        
                        <li><h6>Severability</h6><p>The Investor and the Tantaleum Team agree that if any portion of these Terms is found illegal or unenforceable, in whole or in part, such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective solely to the extent of such determination of invalidity or unenforceability without affecting the validity or enforceability thereof in any other manner or jurisdiction and without affecting the remaining provisions of the Terms, which shall continue to be in full force and effect.</p></li>
                        
                        <li><h6>No Waiver</h6><p>The failure of the Tantaleum Team to require or enforce strict performance by the Investor of any provision of these Terms or the Tantaleum Team’s failure to exercise any right under these agreements shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of the Tantaleum Team 's right to assert or rely upon any such provision or right in that or any other instance. The express waiver by the Tantaleum Team of any provision, condition, or requirement of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with such provision, condition or requirement. Except as expressly and specifically set forth in this these Terms, no representations, statements, consents, waivers, or other acts or omissions by the Tantaleum Team shall be deemed a modification of these Terms nor be legally binding.</p></li>
                        
                        <li><h6>Updates to the Terms and Conditions</h6><p>The Tantaleum Team reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of the Terms at any time during the sale by posting the amended Terms on the Tantaleum website (<a href="https://tantaleum.co/">https://tantaleum.co/</a>). Any Investor will be deemed to have accepted such changes by purchasing TNL. The Terms may not be otherwise amended except in a signed writing executed by both the Investor and the Tantaleum Team. For purposes of this agreement, "writing" does not include an e-mail message and a signature does not include an electronic signature.
